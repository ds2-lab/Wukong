## What is Wukong?

Wukong is a serverless DAG scheduler attuned to AWS Lambda. Wukong provides decentralized scheduling using a combination of static and dynamic scheduling. Wukong supports general Python data analytics workloads. 

## Code Overview/Explanation 

*This section is currently under development...*

### The Static Scheduler

Generally speaking, a user submits a job by calling the `.compute()` function on an underlying Dask collection. Support for Dask's asynchronous `client.compute()` API is coming soon.

When the `.compute()` function is called, the `update_graph()` function is called within the static Scheduler, specifically in **scheduler.py**. This function is responsible for adding computations to the Scheduler's internal graph. It's triggered whenever a Client calls `.submit()`, `.map()`, `.get()`, or `.compute()`. The depth-first search (DFS) method is defined with the `update_graph` function, and the DFS also occurs during the `update_graph` function's execution. 

Once the DFS has completed, the Scheduler will serialize all of the generated paths and store them in the KV Store (Redis). Next, the Scheduler will begin the computation by submitting the leaf tasks to the `BatchedLambdaInvoker` object (which is defined in **batched_lambda_invoker.py**. The "Leaf Task Invoker" processes are defined within the `BatchedLambdaInvoker` class as the `invoker_polling_process` function. Additionally, the `_background_send` function is running asynchronously on an interval (using [Tornado](https://www.tornadoweb.org/en/stable/)). This function takes whatever tasks have been submitted by the Scheduler and divdes them up among itself and the Leaf Task Invoker processes, which then invoke the leaf tasks. 

The Scheduler listens for results from Lambda using a "Subscriber Process", which is defined by the `poll_redis_process` function. This process is created in the Scheduler's `start` function. (All of this is defined in **scheduler.py**.) The Scheduler is also executing the `consume_redis_queue()` function asynchronously (i.e., on the [Tornado IOLoop](https://www.tornadoweb.org/en/stable/ioloop.html)). This function processes whatever messages were received by the aforementioned "Subscriber Process(es)". Whenever a message is processed, it is passed to the `result_from_lambda()` function, which begins the process of recording the fact that a "final result" is available. 

### The KV Store Proxy

...

### The AWS Lambda Task Executor

...

### Developer Setup Notes

When setting up Wukong, make sure to update the variables referencing the name of the AWS Lambda function used as the Wukong Task Executor. For example, in "AWS Lambda Task Executor/function.py", this is a variable *lambda_function_name* whose value should be the same as the name of the Lambda function as defined in AWS Lambda itself.

There is also a variable referencing the function's name in "Static Scheduler/distributed/batched_lambda_invoker.py" (as a keyword argument to the constructor of the BatchedLambdaInvoker object) and in "KV Store Proxy/proxy_lambda_invoker.py" (also as a keyword argument to the constructor of ProxyLambdaInvoker).

By default, Wukong is configured to run within the us-east-1 region. If you would like to use a different region, then you need to pass the "region_name" parameter to the Lambda Client objects created in "Static Scheduler/distributed/batched_lambda_invoker.py", "KV Store Proxy/proxy_lambda_invoker.py", "KV Store Proxy/proxy.py", "AWS Lambda Task Executor/function.py", and "Static Scheduler/distributed/scheduler.py". 

## Code Examples

In the following examples, modifying the value of the *chunks* parameter will essentially change the granularity of the tasks generated in the DAG. Essentially, *chunks* specifies how the initial input data is partitioned. Increasing the size of *chunks* will yield fewer individual tasks, and each task will operate over a large proportion of the input data. Decreasing the size of *chunks* will result in a greater number of individual tasks, with each task operating on a smaller portion of the input data. 

### LocalCluster Overview
```
LocalCluster(object):
  host : string
    The public DNS IPv4 address associated with the EC2 instance on which the Scheduler process is executing, along with the port on 
    which the Scheduler is listening. The format of this string should be "IPv4:port". 
  n_workers : int,
    Artifact from Dask. Leave this at zero.
  proxy_adderss : string,
    The public DNS IPv4 address associated with the EC2 instance on which the KV Store Proxy process is executing.
  proxy_port : 8989,
    The port on which the KV Store Proxy process is listening.
  redis_endpoints : list of tuples of the form (string, int)
    List of the public DNS IPv4 addresses and ports on which KV Store (Redis) instances are listening. The format
    of this list should be [("IP_1", port_1), ("IP_2", port_2), ..., ("IP_n", port_n)] 
  num_lambda_invokers : int
    This value specifies how many 'Initial Task Executor Invokers' should be created by the Scheduler. The 'Initial Task 
    Executor Invokers' are processes that are used by the Scheduler to parallelize the invocation of Task Executors
    associated with leaf tasks. These are particularly useful for large workloads with a big number of leaf tasks.
  max_task_fanout : int
    This specifies the size of a "fanout" required for a Task Executor to utilize the KV Store Proxy for parallelizing downstream
    task invocation. The principle here is the same as with the initial task invokers. Our tests found that invoking Lambda functions
    takes about 50ms on average. As a result, if a given Task T has a large fanout (i.e., there are a large number of downstream tasks 
    directly dependent on T), then it may be advantageous to parallelize the invocation of these downstream tasks.
